Classes & Objects:



- Classes and objects are extremely usefull in python programming and

they can help you to make your program more organisedand more powerful

- When we write a program we have to work with different types of data

- Data like strings bolean numbers we have also structure that store

those data like list dictionary but not all of data can be represnted in

numbers, bolean and string. There is alot of things in real world

we cant reprsent it in string or just a number,

something like a phone or computer or a person.

Those data types cant cover that.

-So with classes and objects we can create our own data types so we can

create a phone data type and it will represent the phone, we can create

a class for it. With the class you can define your own data type.

- let us hypothectically say that we are writing a program for a university

and we want to model a student we want to create a class to to represent student

i want to model a real world object which student. We dont have student

data type, what we can actually do is to create a class for a student.



- create a new file call it car.py and in it we will write a class,

now we can use thangs like strings, bolean and numbers inside the class student

to map out what car should be and what car should have.This is to model car.
